# Flappy Bird AI

## Description

This project is an implementation of the classic game Flappy Bird, with the added twist of an AI-controlled bird that learns to play the game and avoid obstacles using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.

## Features

- Classic Flappy Bird gameplay.
- AI-controlled bird that learns to play the game.
- NEAT algorithm for training the AI.
- Scoring system based on obstacles passed.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
